Portfolio of Product Marketing &amp; Web3 projects by Shreya Sharma
# ðŸš€ Shreya Sharma â€“ Product Marketing x Web3 Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio. Iâ€™m a Product Marketing Manager with 4.5+ years of experience in SaaS, GTM, CRM, and campaign strategy. I'm now exploring the exciting world of Web3.

Now, Iâ€™m combining that experience with deep Web3 learning to become a hybrid PMM â€” someone who can bridge structured SaaS execution with the experimental world of tokens, DAOs, and ecosystems. 

Iâ€™ve created this portfolio to show how I think â€” real work, self-initiated projects, and cross-domain strategies.

I'm looking for a remote-first, high-ownership marketing role where I can make an impact fast, and Iâ€™m ready to relocate to Europe.
