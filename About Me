## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Shreya Sharma** – a full-stack growth and product marketing strategist with 5+ years of experience across SaaS, AI, and emerging tech.

Currently leading the Go to marketing charter at Spectra, I’ve owned everything from brand positioning to performance marketing, landing pages, lifecycle comms, and full-funnel GTM. I specialize in building demand engines from scratch, simplifying complexity, and turning narratives into numbers.

My work spans:
- 🚀 Growth GTM Strategy (3x MQL pipeline in 12 months)
- 🎯 Paid Acquisition (owning $25K+ monthly ad spend across Meta, Google)
- ✍️ Narrative & Brand Design (ICP-specific tone of voice & landing pages)
- 📊 Lifecycle & Automation (HubSpot, WhatsApp, email nurture workflows)
- 🧰 Tools: HubSpot, Figma, Canva, GA4, Meta Ads, Zapier, Notion

I’ve built multi-vertical GTM for:
- 🏘️ PG and Co-Living (Spectra Pro-Fi)
- 🏨 Hospitality (Hotels Wi-Fi GTM)
- 🏢 Managed Internet for Offices
- 🤖 B2B AI tools (Narrative AI Strategy Deck)

If you're building in AI, SaaS, or consumer tech and looking for someone to own GTM or scale growth sustainably—I'd love to connect.
