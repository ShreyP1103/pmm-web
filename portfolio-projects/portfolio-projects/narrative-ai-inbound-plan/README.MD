# Inbound Lead Strategy for Narrative AI (Hiring Task)

## 📌 Context
As part of a take-home assignment for a B2B SaaS company (Narrative AI), I was asked to design a short- and medium-term inbound strategy targeting mid-sized apparel brands. The goal was to educate, nurture, and convert supply chain leaders into MQLs and SQLs using content-led tactics.

## 🎯 My Approach

- Defined Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and built **detailed persona**: Director of Logistics at 250–1000 employee apparel brands in the US.
- Structured a **two-tiered content strategy**:
  - **Short-Term**: Webinars, explainer videos, SEO blogs, and LinkedIn posts for awareness.
  - **Medium-Term**: Case studies, gated whitepapers, ROI calculator, and nurture flows.
- Mapped **content → channel → goal** across a 6-month timeline.
- Proposed **KPIs and success benchmarks** for MQLs, CPL, CTR, and conversion.

## 🚀 Outcomes

This project demonstrated my ability to:
- Build end-to-end inbound campaigns for niche B2B SaaS segments.
- Align content type with funnel stage (awareness to conversion).
- Think like a growth team: optimize for engagement, trust, and lead quality.
