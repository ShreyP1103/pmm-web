# Lifecycle GTM Campaign – PG Segment (B2B Wi-Fi, India 2024)

## 📌 Context

A mid-sized Managed Wi-Fi provider (Spectra) was targeting the PG accommodation segment in India to expand beyond its traditional enterprise and retail verticals. The PG market is highly fragmented, price-sensitive, and driven by tenant experience.

## 🎯 My Role

As Product Marketing Manager, I led the end-to-end Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy for this segment, focusing on:
- ICP definition & pain-point research
- Value proposition articulation
- Messaging for Meta ads and WhatsApp funnels
- Sales enablement and internal training

## 🔍 Approach

- **Segment Research:** Analyzed tenant complaints, owner priorities, and competitor Wi-Fi offerings in 3 major PG markets (Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi NCR).
- **ICP Creation:** Built detailed personas of PG owners (30–150 beds, ARR ₹3–7K).
- **Positioning & Messaging:** Developed copy emphasizing zero Wi-Fi complaints, dual-link failover, 24x7 tenant WhatsApp support.
- **Meta Ad Campaigns:** Launched city-level ads highlighting tenant satisfaction and operational ease.
- **WhatsApp Funnel:** Designed a 3-step auto-reply drip showcasing features, testimonials, and pricing.

## 🚀 Outcomes

- 📈 ~25% increase in lead-to-MQL conversion after funnel redesign
- 🔁 Drop-offs in Meta click-to-WhatsApp reduced by ~40%
- 🛠️ Sales team adopted messaging in 3 cities within 2 weeks
- 🔒 Campaign playbook now used across PG-focused vertical outreach
