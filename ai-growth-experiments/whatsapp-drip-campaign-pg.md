# 📲 WhatsApp Drip Campaign – PG Segment

**Objective:**  
Launch a low-cost, automated nurture journey for PG property owners evaluating a managed Wi-Fi solution.

## 💡 Why WhatsApp?

Our PG audience was mobile-first, often less active on email but responsive on WhatsApp. We used this insight to shift the lifecycle campaign from email to WhatsApp.

## 🛠️ AI Contribution

- Used **ChatGPT** to:
  - Draft conversational WhatsApp messages for each lifecycle stage
  - Localize tone and simplify jargon for non-technical owners
  - A/B test message hooks like pricing, emotion, and credibility
